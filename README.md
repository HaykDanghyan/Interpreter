# This is an interpreter which translates the "programming language" crated by myself
# So the code may be non-professional
# Special thanks to my teacher Hayk Darbinyan , who gave me a lot of useful advises while writing this code
There are 3 types in my programming language and there are
# var str alg
var replaces to int in C++
str replaces to std::string in C++
alg replaces to bool in C++
std::cout in C++ is equal to "out" in my programming language
chc is equal to the condition if(it means check) 
rep is equal to the while loop (rep means repeat)
